# Virtual Terminal
Small side project I made in a few days while in school
<br><br>
The code is very basic, it uses few python packages and not anything special.
<br><br>
Note: probably like 30% or so of the code is made by AI, since at the time I was using replit to make Virtual Terminal and decided to use a bit of the built in AI features.

# Features
<b>Fake file system, with the option to create, edit, read, and delete "files", these files are simply values in the operating system table that have properties like "content", "creation date", "file name", and "file type".</b>
<br><br>
<b>Ability to run python code inside the terminal, you can create a new file with python code in it, then run the code with a command.</b>
<br><br>
<b>Get the current system date with the "date" command.</b>

# Note for developers
I made it easy to add new commands into Virtual Terminal if you would like to fork it and add your own stuff to it, might take a bit of understanding, just make sure to look into the "commands.py" file and read the source carefully if you want to learn how to add your own commands.
